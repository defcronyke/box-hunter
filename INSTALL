How To Build Box Hunter On Linux
================================
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed under /usr or /usr/local:
	glew-1.9.0
	SDL-2.0.0
	box2d-2.1.2
	cmake 2.8

2. Go into the project's root folder:
	cd ~/Downloads/box-hunter

3. Make a new build folder and go inside it:
	If "build" dir is already present: rm -rf build
	mkdir build
	cd build

4. Generate Makefiles:
	cmake ..

5. Build the game:
	make
	
6. Strip the debug symbols:
	strip box-hunter

7. Play the game:
	./box-hunter

Optional

8. Now you can copy the contents of the build folder somewhere else if you want.
   (You only need to copy "box-hunter" and "shaders/")
